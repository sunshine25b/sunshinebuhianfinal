Certainly! Here's an example of an HTML code for an online shopping website design with 10 navigation links:

 
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Online Shopping Website</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Products</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Categories</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Cart</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">About Us</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Deals</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">FAQ</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Shipping</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Returns</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>

  <main>
    <!-- Rest of the website content goes here -->
  </main>

  <footer>
    <p>&copy; 2023 Online Shopping Website. All rights reserved.</p>
  </footer>
</body>
</html>
 

In this example, the HTML code includes a navigation menu with 10 links to different sections of the website. The links include "Home," "Products," "Categories," "Cart," "Contact," "About Us," "Deals," "FAQ," "Shipping," and "Returns."

You can customize the link text and add additional navigation links as per your website's requirements. Additionally, you can style the navigation menu using CSS to match your desired design.

Feel free to modify and enhance this HTML code to suit your specific online shopping website design needs. Happy coding!
